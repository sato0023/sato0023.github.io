					<h2>Some History</h2>
					<p>"The term Camera Obscura in Latin means "dark room". Leonardo da Vinci put the word of Camera Obscura as his writing record in the century 14th. After Louis Daguerre invented the daguerreotype process and it developed to the darkroom as worked in the tent or dark room to develop the film and papers processing in the 18 century.</p>
					<p>	A gelatin silver print is composed of four layers: paper base, baryta, gelatin binder, and a protective gelatin layer or overcoat. The paper base or support serves as the substrate onto which the subsequent layers are attached. Paper is in many ways an ideal support: it is lightweight, flexible, and strong enough to withstand both wet processing and regular handling. The photographic paper base must be free of photoactive impurities such as iron and lignins. In order to obtain this purity, the paper was originally made from cotton rags, though after World War I there was a transition to purified wood pulp, which has been used ever since.The second layer is the baryta, a white coating made primarily from gelatin and barium sulfate. Dyes were often added to modify color. The purpose of the baryta layer is to cover the paper fibers and form a smooth surface upon which to coat the gelatin. Surfaces such as smooth, fine-grained, or silk can be created using a variety of textured felts and marking rollers in the making of the paper base, by variable cal- endaring of the paper base both before and after baryta coating, and by embossing the baryta-coated paper." - Source: tammyumaly.com</p>

			<h3>Do It For The Grain</h3>
				<p>In March, a few friends and I put on a show at Driphouse in Hintonburg where we showed darkroom prints. Around town, you can also find our free zine - a semi-regular publication of local analog photographers working in black and white.</p>
